  <h1>Blackjack Rules</h1>
  <div class="rules-box">
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Get as close to 21 as possible without going over.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number cards are worth their face value.</li>
      <li>Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10.</li>
      <li>Ace can be worth 1 or 11, whichever benefits the player more.</li>
      <li>Each round starts with two cards.</li>
      <li>You can choose to draw a new card ("Hit") or stay with your hand ("Stand").</li>
      <li>If your sum goes above 21, you bust and lose the round.</li>
      <li>Blackjack = An Ace + a 10-value card (Jack, Queen, King, or 10).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color:#ffcc00;">ðŸ’° Chips System</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Starting a game costs <strong>$10 chips</strong>.</li>
    <li>Winning with a <strong>Blackjack</strong> rewards <strong>$75 chips</strong>.</li>
    <li>Your current chip balance is always displayed under the game.</li>
    <li>If you run out of chips, you cannot start a new game.</li>
  </ul>
    <p><strong>Winning:</strong> The closer you are to 21 than the dealer, without going over, the more you win!</p>
